Team Project: Exploring Netflix Shows and Movies

Team Members: Matthew Hill, Rolly Costillas, Derek Mast, Chang Woon Jang

Project Description/Outline
  By looking at several datasets from kaggle and omdbapi from 2019 to March 2022, we can see changes in views tastes over the last four years. We will be looking at types of show, genre and release dates to find patterns in the most successful Netflix shows and movies. With the help of APIâ€™s we can get more information out of our database including genre and metacritic scores. We are going to visualize our analysis by graphs and plots including bar, scatter, line, etc. Statistical analysis methods will be used to describe and summarize our findings and possibly provide us with a confidence level of predictions. 

Question: How does Netflix keep its user base interested and continue to do so?
   1) Movies or TV shows in the past?
   2) Relationship between a country and the number of movies and TV shows?
   3) Specific genres of movies and TV shows based on past trends?
   4) What was the popular type of entertainment on Netflix during the pandemic?
   5) What Kind of Content Appeared in the Daily Top 10?
